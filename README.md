   # Timer 🕐

   <i>
   The "Timer" is a React application that encompasses various advanced concepts, such as ContextAPI, useReducer, immer, form handling, ESLint, routing, and more. This project serves as a Pomodoro timer, allowing users to input task names and allocate dedicated time intervals. Users can start, pause, or complete tasks, and all Pomodoro cycles are stored in local storage, accessible via the application's history page. Additionally, the application offers a light and dark theme toggle, the ability to clear historical data, and task recommendations based on past usage.
